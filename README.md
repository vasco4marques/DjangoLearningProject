# DjangoLearningProject
 With this project I aim to learn Django and try to improve my skills until I'm bored

## What i've looked into
    -Dynamic HTML creation with python
    -Django forms and custom forms
    -User registration
    -Log in and user authentication
    -User specific pages

### I also tried to look into css and bootstrap to make my website look clean but I hate it :)
